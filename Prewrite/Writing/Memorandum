RE: Recycle Programs

SunSpar is currently doing a great job recycling. However, we could do much better- most of the trash that comes out of
a facility like ours can recycle. Our recycling efforts are important because Cape Town  must meet a State-mandated goal
of recycling 50% of its trash by the year by 2020, or face fines up to $10,000 per day. The state goal of the regulation
is to, "reduce greenhouse emissions". Since our business produce over 50% of the city's watse, t is critical that we do our share to help the City meet the 
recyling goal. Recyling has an additional benifit of reducing our waste disposal expenses, which helps improve our bottom line.
And of course, recycling helps preserve natural resources-every ton of paper recycled saves 17 trees!

With this in mind, I would like to remind everyone of the recycling oppotunities available here at SunSpar. The enclosed flyer
decribes what is recyclable in our company's recycling program. I encourage you to read this infromation carefully and actively 
participate in calling National Reccling at +(0)11-xxx-xxxx.

Thank you for your assistance and participation.
